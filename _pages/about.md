Starting in September 2025, Iâ€™m excited to embark on my MPhil journey at the HKU School of Computing and Data Science under the supervision of [Prof. Ka-Ho Chow](https://khchow.com/). I previously received my BEng in Computer Science from HKU, where I was supervised by [Prof. Kenneth K.Y. Wong](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~kykwong/).
